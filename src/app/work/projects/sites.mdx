## Overview

This work focuses on designing and building modern web interfaces with a strong emphasis on clarity, usability, and responsiveness.  
The objective was to create clean and intuitive user experiences while ensuring the codebase remains maintainable and scalable.

These projects combine frontend development and web design, bridging visual design and implementation.

## Key Features

- **Modern UI Development**  
  Built interactive and responsive user interfaces using React and Next.js, following modern frontend best practices.

- **Component-Based Architecture**  
  Structured interfaces as reusable components to ensure consistency and scalability across pages.

- **Responsive Design**  
  Designed layouts that adapt smoothly across screen sizes using CSS and utility-first styling.

- **Design-to-Code Workflow**  
  Translated visual ideas and layouts into functional interfaces with attention to spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript & TypeScript**: Core languages for frontend logic and type safety.
- **React.js**: Component-based UI development.
- **Next.js**: Routing, performance optimizations, and modern React tooling.
- **CSS & Tailwind CSS**: Styling, layout, and responsive design.
- **Figma**: UI exploration and layout planning.

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was balancing visual design with technical constraints, especially when building responsive layouts that remain consistent across devices.  
This work strengthened my understanding of component-driven development and the importance of clean, readable frontend code.

## Outcome

The resulting interfaces are visually clean, responsive, and easy to navigate.  
These projects demonstrate my ability to design and implement frontend solutions that combine aesthetics, usability, and solid technical foundations.
