## Overview

This project focused on automating morphological measurements from 3D medical images using Python.  
The objective was to replace manual, time-consuming measurements with reliable and reproducible computational workflows, while keeping expert validation through visual review.

## Key Features

- **Automated Measurement Extraction**  
  Built Python scripts to compute metrics such as length, width, circumference, and volume from 3D segmentations.

- **Repeatability & Reproducibility Analysis**  
  Implemented analysis workflows to quantify measurement consistency across repeated runs and subjects.

- **Tool Integration for Visual Validation**  
  Integrated scripting with 3D Slicer to visualize outputs, validate bounding boxes, and support expert review.

- **Structured Outputs for Analysis**  
  Exported clean datasets suitable for downstream statistics and reporting.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **3D Slicer (Python API)**, **VTK**

## Challenges and Learnings

Ensuring anatomical relevance required careful handling of reference frames and systematic visual verification.  
This project reinforced best practices around robust Python code in research-critical contexts: reproducibility, traceability, and validation loops.

## Outcome

The automation significantly reduced manual measurement time while improving consistency and transparency.  
The workflow scales to larger datasets and provides a strong base for future extensions such as statistical modeling or ML-based analysis.
